# CSE-401-Contemporary-Computer-Architecture
Design methodology; processor units and control units of von Neumann computer architectures; RISC architectures, including pipelining and parallel-processing.

# **Course Objective:**

To provide the basic knowledge of computer architec-ture and how the influences of VLSI technology, highlevel languages, and assembly language interacts inthe design of hardware. Upon successful completionof this course, the student will have learned the tech-niques and theories of:
1. Performance metrics
2. Arithmetic and ALU
3. Hardware and Microprogrammed Control
4. Pipelining
5. Cache and Virtual Memory
6. Bus and I/O
